# Silvio's Custom HA Components

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=silviokennecke&repository=ha-custom-components&category=plugin)

This repository contains the custom components and cards I use in my home assistant installation.

A documentation of the components and cards can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/silviokennecke/ha-custom-components/wiki).

Please not that I develop the components in this repository in my very rare free time. So it might happen, that it takes a while for me to respond to issues. However, feel free to make suggestions or create PRs.
